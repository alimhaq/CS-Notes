# Python

## Explanation

Similar to Ruby, Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language (written in C) that uses whitespace for code blocks. This illustrates the main design philosophy of Pythonâ€“to be very clear and concise to read. Python, like Ruby, features dynamic typing (one does not need to explicitly declare the type of data a variable will hold) and has automatic memory management (some languages, like C, require you to explicitly ask for memory, and then explicitly free the memory after usage).

## Application

Python is widely used in academia today, and has many applications in academia. In particular, Python has seen a rise in use in the realm of machine learning.
