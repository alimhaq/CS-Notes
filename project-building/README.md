# Project Building

Code is quite useful for building out interesting ideas. While building things in the "physical world" requires an investment into the production materials, coding projects can all be done through a computer. One does not need to start from scratch either: there are many frameworks out there that help expedite the creation of projects, whether it be a website, or a simple game.
