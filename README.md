# Computer Science Notes

This repository will hold any notes taken related to computer science. The notes will emphasize learning concepts at a fundamental, appropriate level of abstraction. Emphasis will be on simplicity; if a concept cannot be explained simply and clearly at first, it is likely that the concept is not well understood.
