# Computer Science Notes

This repository will hold any notes taken related to computer science. These notes will emphasize learning concepts at a fundamental, appropriate level of abstraction. Emphasis will be on simplicity; if a concept cannot be explained simply and clearly, it is likely that the concept is not well understood.

The notes will be partitioned into two main sets (for now): *problem solving* and *project building*. While both of these topics obviously have some overlap, the notes will attempt to distinguish their practices for the sake of clarity.

## Subjects

* Problem Solving
* Project Building
